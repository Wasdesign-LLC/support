## Questions & Answers


<details><summary><b>Why is the app not syncing between my iPhone and iPad?</b></summary>
<p>

Pencil Planner syncs automatically to your other devices using your iCloud account. If you are having trouble, here are a few things to try:

<ol>
  <li>Both devices are on the same iCloud account and sync is on. Settings > Your Account > iCloud - verify "Pencil Planner" is set to "on"</li>
  <li>iCloud storage is not full (Settings > Your Account > iCloud) and iCloud drive is turned on</li>
  <li>Both devices need to have the latest version of the Pencil Planner app (check the App Store)</li>
  <li>If the above requirements are verified the devices should sync. But finally, it seems there is a bug where sometimes the updated pages don't show up live, so if you write on one device you may have to wait 15-20 seconds on the 2nd device before killing and reopening the app and the updated canvas should be there. We hope to have a fix for this in the next version.</li>
</ol>
