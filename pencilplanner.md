# Pencil Planner Support

## Questions & Answers


<details><summary>*Why is the app not syncing between my iPhone and iPad?*</summary>
<p>

Pencil Planner syncs automatically to your other devices using your iCloud account. If you are having trouble, here are a few things to try:

1. Both devices are on the same iCloud account and sync is on. Settings > Your Account > iCloud - verify "Pencil Planner" is set to "on"
2. iCloud storage is not full (Settings > Your Account > iCloud) and iCloud drive is turned on
3. Both devices need to have the latest version of the Pencil Planner app (check the App Store)
4. If the above requirements are verified the devices should sync. But finally, it seems there is a bug where sometimes the updated pages don't show up live, so if you write on one device you may have to wait 15-20 seconds on the 2nd device before killing and reopening the app and the updated canvas should be there. We hope to have a fix for this in the next version.
