## Questions & Answers

Thank you for being willing to search our answers to the mysteries of the universe! I assure you, we do not have all of those answers here, but hopefullly we can help you get answers to the questions you have about Pencil Planner & Calendar Pro on iOS.

#### Why is the app not syncing between my iPhone and iPad?

First of all, we understand this is frustrating, but we have solutions! Pencil Planner syncs automatically to your other devices using your iCloud account. If you are having trouble, here are a few things to try:

1. Ensure both devices are on the same iCloud account and sync is on. Settings > Your Account > iCloud - verify "Pencil Planner" is set to "on"
2. Verify iCloud storage is not full (Settings > Your Account > iCloud) and iCloud drive is turned on
3. Check that both devices have the latest version of the Pencil Planner app (check the App Store)
4. If the above suggestions are verified the devices should sync. But finally, it seems there is a bug where sometimes the updated pages don't show up live, so if you write on one device you may have to wait 15-20 seconds on the 2nd device before killing and reopening the app and the updated canvas should be there. We hope to have a fix for this in the next version.

#### How do I print a day/week/month/year?

We totally get it, you live in the real world, and sometimes you need a physical copy! We are working on a share feature that should be in your hands within weeks. In the meantime, you can take a screenshot and crop it to print. This is super convenient with an Apple Pencil, as you can follow these instructions:
1. Move the pencil tools to the top right of the screen and make sure they are collapsed
2. Drag in using the pencil from either of the bottom corners of the screen
3. Crop the image to the Calendar view you would like to print
4. Tap the Share button in the top right, and select Print! Voila!
_TIP: you can always use these same steps to create and image if you would like to email, text, or even tweet it. (be careful not to alert the Paparazzi though!)_

#### How do I get my Apple/Google/Outlook Calendar to load into the app?

Fantastic question, it's like you can see the future! We are working on this feature *now*, and hope to have it in a version soon during Q1 2020.

#### Why can't I see what I wrote in the Month view while on the week view?

You've done it again, read our minds! This feature, as well as seeing the week entry on the day view we hope to make available Q1.
