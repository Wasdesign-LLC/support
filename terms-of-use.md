# Terms of Use

## About these Terms

If you are going to use our Services, you must agree to the provisions of this TOS to protect both you and us. If you use our Services, this TOS applies to that use, but here are some of the points about the Websites, Applications, and Services that you should be particularly aware of:

* The TOS includes a class action waiver and waiver of jury trials and requires binding arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes relating in any way to your use of the Services. By entering into the TOS, you are waiving your right to seek relief in a court of law. See below for additional information.
* If you subscribe to certain Paid Services (as defined in the “Fees” section) for a term (the “Initial Term”), then the term will be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the Initial Term at our then-current fee for such Paid Services, unless you opt out of the auto-renewal in accordance with the Section entitled “Fees” below.
* We provide communication services, such as email, that consume storage space on our servers. You may be provided with the option to purchase additional storage entitlements.
* We own everything we have produced for the Website, the Application, the Services, the Software (defined below) and any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, videos, messages, tags or other materials (“Content”) available on the Application, Website or in the Services (collectively, the “Wasdesign Properties”). Use of these Wasdesign Properties without our permission by any third party is expressly prohibited. This excludes any data or other content you upload to our Services.
* You use the Services at your own risk, and we aren’t responsible or liable for any problems that might arise from your use of the Services. We do not make any warranties about our Services. If lawfully determined we are liable for something, our liability is limited as described below.
* In addition, we may link to or present additional terms for certain Services which we refer to as “Supplemental Terms” for such Services (and those Supplemental Terms, together with these TOS, are referred to in this agreement as the “Terms”). Those Supplemental Terms will take precedent if there is any conflict between the Supplemental Terms and these TOS. To use the Services, you must be of legal age to form a binding contract and you must have the authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of yourself (“you”).

## General Terms

We may change, add, or delete portions of these Terms at any time on a going-forward basis. Your use or continued use of the Websites, Applications the Services (including following the posting of any changes to these Terms) constitutes your acceptance of these Terms and any associated changes.

Furthermore, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from a mobile app store (an “App Store Sourced Application”), you will only use the App Store Sourced Application (i) on a product authorized to run the mobile operating system (e.g. iOS or Android) and (ii) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the mobile app store’s Terms of Service.

You will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Wasdesign Properties.

## Fees 

### General

We reserve the right to offer certain premium Services or features subject to payments now or in the future (the “Paid Services”). Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service constitute Supplemental Terms. Any purchase will be applied to your account at the time of purchase. In certain cases, the Paid Services may be provided by or through a third party. As such, you agree to (a) review the terms of use and privacy policies of those third parties before providing your banking or payment information and (b) contact those third parties for all payment related questions, issues, disagreements and/or disputes. You agree that you are not relying on the future availability of any feature or product offered through the Wasdesign Properties in agreeing to or making payments hereunder. We reserve the right to remove or amend the available payment methods at our sole discretion.

### Automatic Renewal

Where offered, your subscription to Paid Services will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with this Section. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically renew on the first day following the end of such period (each, a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an equivalent period, at Wasdesign’s then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature until you cancel your subscription in the mobile app store. By subscribing, you authorize Wasdesign or its agent, e.g. Apple or Google, to charge the payment method on file (e.g. Mastercard or Visa) directly or indirectly, now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.

## Applications 

You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application and the Services is dependent on the third party from whom you received the Application license, e.g. the mobile app store (“App Store”). You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Wasdesign and not with the mobile app store. Wasdesign, not the mobile app store, is solely responsible for the Application and Services, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty thereof and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g. product liability, legal compliance, or intellectual property infringement). You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the mobile app store in connection with the Application or Services. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Application is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of service (e.g. the mobile app store’s terms and policies) when using the Application and the Services. You acknowledge that the mobile app store (and its subsidiaries) are third party beneficiaries of these Terms and will have the right to enforce them.

### Account Inactivity

Inactive accounts may be removed after a period of inactivity not less than 180 days. In this context, inactive is defined as:

Not maintaining an active, paid subscription; and
Not opening the Application; and
Not using the Application’s capabilities offered on its free plan.

Removal of an account includes removing all associated data with the account.

## General Provisions

The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights.

### Assignment

In the event that the last email address you provided to Wasdesign is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by these Terms, Wasdesign’s dispatch of the email containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice.

### Severability

If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### Export Control

You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Wasdesign Properties except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the Wasdesign Properties, and any other applicable laws.

## Disclaimer of Warranties 

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR USE OF THE WASDESIGN PROPERTIES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THE WASDESIGN PROPERTIES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITH ALL FAULTS. THE WASDESIGN PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SECURITY, AND NON- INFRINGEMENT.

## Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver; Waiver of Trial by Jury 

Please read this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It is part of your contract with Wasdesign and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. By agreeing to arbitration, you are waiving your right to seek relief in a court of law.

i. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Websites, Applications or Services, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claim(s) qualify. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that you will not bring any class action claims in small claims court. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement.

ii. Waiver of Jury Trial. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow these Terms as a court would.

iii. Commencement of Arbitration Proceeding. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a certified letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Wasdesign, LLC, 965 E 600 S, Salt Lake City, UT 84102. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its rules. JAMS’ rules are available at www.jamsadr.com. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS’ rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Wasdesign will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.

iv. No Class Actions. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
