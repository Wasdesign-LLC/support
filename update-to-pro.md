## Upgrading to Pro

All users who have purchased Pencil Planner 1 (`Pencil Planner & Draw Calendar`) are entitled to a 6 month free trial of Pencil Planner Pro (`Pencil Planner & Calendar Pro`) ($18 USD Value).

## FAQ

### How do I get the 6 month free trial?

Once Pencil Planner Pro has been launched you will find a promo code available in the settings of Pencil Planner 1. We will add further instructions here after launch day as well.

### Why a second app (Pencil Planner Pro) instead of adding those features to the first app (Pencil Planner 1)?

As we tried to design the ideal planner, we quickly found that the features we wanted in Pro were impossible with the templates from v1. So, we totally redesigned it from the ground up! This allowed us to provide several amazing features we wouldn't have been able to otherwise, including:

1. A week view with the schedule for each day
2. Calendar integration across day, week, month
3. A main event cell displayed on each day which also shows on the week and month
4. Much better support for iPhone and split screen
5. A much more reliable storage mechanism 
6. User accounts which will make it possible to share calendars between users in the future (see our Roadmap)

### Why is it a subscription instead of a one time charge?

There are multiple reasons, including:

1. With Pencil Planner Pro we securely store your unlimited entries on our servers. This will prevent data loss and can give you peace of mind that your entries are always backed up. However, entries can get large and there is a cost to maintain all that data. A subscription helps cover that cost.
2. We have a very long list of features on our Roadmap for Pencil Planner Pro. But, we are a small development team. A subscription allows us to continue improving Pencil Planner Pro, releasing the features on the roadmap into the Pro app. If you haven't already, visit our Roadmap and see what's coming soon to Pencil Planner Pro!
